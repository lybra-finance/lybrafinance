Ethereum 2.0, also known as ETH 2.0 or Serenity, is anupgrade to the Ethereum network that aims to transition from a proof-of-work(PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS). Staking involves locking upa certain amount of cryptocurrency to support network operations and earn rewards in return.</div><div>The omnichain universe is here to stay, but the infrastructure is fragmented. For bridging, the focus is on user driven asset movement between chains. Although this sounds like an intuitive approach, it&rsquo;s actually far from practical. For example if you want to yield farm on a hot new chain you must swap your assets to a bridgeable asset, bridge, and then farm all in a 20+ click multi-transaction session. In an ideal world you could swap, bridge and farm all in one transaction from the source chain.</div><img src="images/6500041fe0fcd22fbf3aa69c-650008e5efaa1fc992bbe28c_44126f3f922c1e8e16e39f8e5680213c.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""><div>Introducing Stargate, the <strong>first</strong> and <strong>only</strong> bridge to solve the Bridging Trilemma, unlocking seamless composability; enabling the wrapping of all existing DeFi applications. For example, the video below shows how you could wrap Stargate and Uniswap to perform an any asset to any asset swap in a single click between chains.</div><h2>Launch</h2><div>In two days (March 17th), Stargate&rsquo;s liquidity generation event begins, leading off with an auction followed by Stargate going live with a simultaneous bonding curve. <strong>All funds raised during the event will be owned by the protocol.</strong></div><h2>Auction<br></h2><ul role="list"><li>Starts 12pm EDT March 17th, 2022 on https://stargate.finance</li><li>100M STG tokens available (10% of total supply) [MetaMask &amp; WalletConnect supported]</li><li>Auction ends when $25M USDC has been purchased or after 48 hours have elapsed, whichever comes first, making the maximum price per token $0.25</li><li>At the end of the auction the 100M STG is frozen for 12mo followed by 6mo linear unlocking for participants</li></ul><img src="images/6500041fe0fcd22fbf3aa69c-65000a5a5b719db40c194e12_64f579a858fe75c666b4a5f8_1_FhGsNWeB9l01tOlFgacFZg.jpeg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6500041fe0fcd22fbf3aa69c/65000a5a5b719db40c194e12_64f579a858fe75c666b4a5f8_1_FhGsNWeB9l01tOlFgacFZg-p-500.jpeg 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6500041fe0fcd22fbf3aa69c/65000a5a5b719db40c194e12_64f579a858fe75c666b4a5f8_1_FhGsNWeB9l01tOlFgacFZg.jpeg 700w" alt=""><h2>Here are some key points about Lido staking:</h2><h3 class="heading-3"><strong>StakingService</strong></h3><div>Lido provides a staking facility that allows users to staketheir Ethereum (ETH) and receive stETH (Staked Ether) tokens in return. stETHrepresents a claim on the staking rewards generated by the ETH deposited in theLido staking pool.</div><h3><strong>LiquidStaking</strong></h3><div>Lido'sapproach to staking is known as "liquid staking." This means thatwhen you stake your ETH with Lido, you receive stETH tokens in return, whichare liquid and can be freely traded or used in other DeFi applications. This isdifferent from traditional staking, where your funds are locked up.</div><div>Assuming the auction is sold out within the 48 hours, the collected $25M will be paired with an additional 50M STG and be immediately put into a Curve v2 pool, pricing the token at $0.50/STG with $50M of liquidity depth.</div><h2><strong>Bonding Curve</strong></h2><div>Upon conclusion of the auction, <strong>Stargate and the bonding curves will go live</strong> on all seven chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Fantom, Arbitrum and Optimism). Assuming the auction phase ends at the hard cap, bonding curves will run from $0.50 - $1.50.</div><div>Assuming the auction is sold out within the 48 hours, the collected $25M will be paired with an additional 50M STG and be immediately put into a Curve v2 pool, pricing the token at $0.50/STG with $50M of liquidity depth.</div><img src="images/6500041fe0fcd22fbf3aa69c-65000accbd5448ce08d4c117_64f579a83070b0fe99f42fe4_1_8Ykd5nwhPUDk65udmBjbfQ.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6500041fe0fcd22fbf3aa69c/65000accbd5448ce08d4c117_64f579a83070b0fe99f42fe4_1_8Ykd5nwhPUDk65udmBjbfQ-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6500041fe0fcd22fbf3aa69c/65000accbd5448ce08d4c117_64f579a83070b0fe99f42fe4_1_8Ykd5nwhPUDk65udmBjbfQ.png 700w" alt=""><div>With Stargate live on all seven chains you will be able to swap Stargate enabled assets freely between the chains allowing for everyone to participate in bonding everywhere. The bonding curve will last for 72 hours and the remainder of the tokens will be returned to the protocol.</div><h3><strong>DecentralizedValidators</strong></h3><div>Lidouses a network of decentralized validators to stake the ETH on behalf of users.Validators are responsible for participating in the Ethereum PoS network andearning rewards, which are then distributed to stakers in the form of stakingrewards.</div><h3><strong>EarningRewards</strong></h3><div>By staking with Lido, you can earn a share of the rewardsgenerated by the validators.
